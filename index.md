Hello, I am Kunal Agarwal from VJTI, Mumbai. This is the first time I'll be applying for GSoC. After going through a vast array of Organisations and learning about their projects, I finally found "*OpenGL/OpenCL software ISP*" project of **libcamera** most interesting.

## Getting Started

I joined the IRC and subscribed to libcamera's mailing list and started exploring the project in detail. After discussion with mentors on IRC, I started with the Warmup tasks listed under my project. And to sum up my journey of completing all the warmup tasks, along with the challenges faced by me and how I solved them, I am writing this blog.

## Getting Warmed up
Warmup tasks were provided under each project for new contributors to get familiar with the code base and complete the pre-requisites of the project interested in. I too started understanding and implementing these tasks.
