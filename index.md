**Hello, I am Kunal Agarwal from VJTI, Mumbai. This is the first time I'll be applying for GSoC. After going through a vast array of Organisations and learning about their projects, I finally found "OpenGL/OpenCL software ISP" project of *libcamera* most interesting.**

**Therefore I joined the IRC and subscribed to libcamera's mailing list and started exploring the project in detail. After discussion with mentors on IRC, I started with the Warmup tasks listed under my project. And to sum up my journey of completing all the warmup task, along with challenges faced by me and how I solved them, I am writing this blog**
